ParvShop
=========

An ecommerce website created for our Database Lab Project. The website contains features such as placing orders, changing order quantities(Admin only), updating your shopping cart and registering new users.

Setup
=========

1. To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server. Using XAMPP or any stack will suffice.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the bolt.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. Upload all the files on your local server. If you are using XAMPP on Ubuntu, copy the files to /opt/xampp/htdocs.
4. The admin accounts on this can be found in the SQL file. 
5. Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
6. Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.
